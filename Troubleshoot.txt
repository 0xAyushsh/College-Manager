When checking out the project using version control in Android Studio 3.6 or higher, an error pops up saying
"Unsupported Module Detected." once the import is completed. This is a bug with either Github or with Android Studio, 
regardless, in order to solve this, follow the following 3 steps:
1. Go to File->Sync Project with Gradle files. Wait for completion. 
2. Then, Go to Build->Clean Project.
3. Then, Go to Build->Rebuild Project. Wait for rebuild to complete.

After the above 3 steps, everything should work fine.
